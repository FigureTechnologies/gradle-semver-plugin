# Gradle Semver Plugin

Opinionated plugin broadly based on a [Git Flow workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) without release branches, the following branches are supported:

* main
* develop
* feature/xxx
* hotfix/xxx

## Version Calculation

The semver is calculated primarily based on:
* the version of the base branch
* the current branch
* the scope & stage properties declared for the current branch (or the default values for the branch in the absence of explicit settings)

The `Scope` property has following valid values: 
* Major
* Minor
* Patch
and refers to the semver component to alter when determining the current version. 

The `Stage` property refers to the label (typically for pre-release builds) following the patch component, eg: given `1.2.3-alpha.1`, the `Stage` would be `alpha`. The supported stages are:
* Final - results in a release version, eg `1.2.3`
* Snapshot - results in a snapshot version, eg `1.2.3-SNAPSHOT`
* Alpha - `1.2.3-alpha.1`
* Beta - `1.2.3-alpha.2`
* RC - `1.2.3-rc.1`
 
### Main Branch
                                                                             
_**The main branch is the only branch that should be tagged with versions.**_ The calculated version is based on the most recent version on the `main` branch which is then modified based on the scope & stage properties for `main`.
eg. given 

```kotlin
currentBranch {
    scope("patch")
    stage("final")
}
```

when the last version tag on main is `v1.2.3` the new version would be calculated as `v1.2.4` 

*Default Stage*: `Final`
*Default Scope*: `Minor`

### Develop Branch

The `develop` branch should be rebased from main before releasing (eg locally or to a staging system). 
The calculated version is based on the most recent version on the `main` branch which is then modified based on the scope & stage properties for `develop`, eg given

```kotlin
currentBranch {
    scope("patch")
    stage("beta")
}
```

when the last version tag on main is `v1.2.3` the new version would be calculated as `v1.2.4-beta.1`. The `.1` in the stage indicates there has been 1 commit since the branch point. 

*Default Stage*: `Beta`
*Default Scope*: `Patch`

### Feature & Hotfix Branches

Feature & Hotfix branches are similar to `develop` but:
* `feature/xxx` is always branched from `develop` and the version is calculated based on the latest in `develop` 
  * eg, if main is at `v1.2.3`, develop is at `v1.2.4-beta.0`, the feature branch could be `v1.2.5-alpha.0`
* `hotfix/xxx` is always branched from `main` and the version is calculated based on the latest in `main`
            
Feature branches can be customized with a regex to match the branch name, eg:

`featureBranchRegex(listOf("[a-zA-Z\\-_0-9]+\\/sc-\\d+\\/[a-zA-Z\\-_0-9]+"))` will allow `peter/sc-123123/add_new_feature` to be considered as a feature branch.

*Feature Default Stage*: `Alpha`
*Feature Default Scope*: `Patch`

*Hotfix Default Stage*: `Beta`
*Hotfix Default Scope*: `Patch`

## Usage

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.github.nefilim.gradle.semver-plugin") version "<latest version>"
}

// semver extension must be declared before invoking semver.version()  
semver {
    // all properties are optional but it's a good idea to declare those that you would want  
    // to override with Gradle properties or environment variables, eg "overrideVersion" below
    verbose(true)
    tagPrefix("v")
    initialVersion("0.0.3")
    findProperty("semver.overrideVersion")?.toString()?.let { overrideVersion(it) }
    featureBranchRegex(listOf("[a-zA-Z\\-_0-9]+\\/sc-\\d+\\/[a-zA-Z\\-_0-9]+"))
    currentBranch {
        scope(findProperty("semver.currentBranch.scope")?.toString())
        stage(findProperty("semver.currentBranch.stage")?.toString())
    }
}

version = semver.version
```

_**PLEASE NOTE:**_ the `semver` stanza should be declared **before** the `semver` extension functions are used.

Two extension properties are available on the `semver` extension:

* `version: String` returns the calculated version
* `versionTagName: String` returns the tag name for the current calculated version, ie `tagPrefix` + `version`   

The plugin supports a two tasks: 
* `cv` that will print out the current calculated version
* `generateVersionFile` that will generate `build/semver/version.txt` containing the raw version and the tag version
