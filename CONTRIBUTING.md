ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for wanting to contribute! 
We are always looking for bug fixes, changes, and new features.

## Licensing

One thing we need to ensure is that we maintain a license header on each source file.
We have automated this through the use of a gradle plugin.
To re-generate the license headers, simply run:

```
./gradlew updateLicenses
```

More info about this plugin is available on github: https://github.com/CadixDev/licenser
